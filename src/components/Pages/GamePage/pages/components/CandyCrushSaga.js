				<BigImage googleId={"11tRpftYm0UfrJvjvb6cme4KPW--9mEd3"} />
				<p>
				In September 2015, I joined King to work as a game artist on <em>Candy Crush Saga</em>. During this time I have largely focused 
				on content production, live operations and innovating existing art and designs.
				<br /><br />
				For more information on the game and my time working with it, please check out these awesome opportunities I've had 
				representing King as a spokesperson by clicking the links below!
				</p>
				<LinkGroup links={links} />
				<LinkGroup links={links2} />
				<LinkGroup links={links3} /><br /><br />
				<Thumbnails thumbnails={thumbnails} positions={[0,1,2]} height={248} marginBottom={0} />
				<p>
				<em>Candy Crush Saga</em> is a free-to-play match-three puzzle game which was first released in 2012.
				<br /><br />
				Going strong for over seven years, the game and its sister titles have turned into one of the industryâ€™s most
				recognizable franchises, with over a billion unique players around the world able to play thousands of levels.
				</p>
				<BigImage googleId={"1xxbnPOLAPc9bIhN9_CFAc7nSzh1Br1K7"} />
				<p>
				Having been part of one of the longest running live games to date for nearly five years, my contributions
				have varied greatly.<br /><br /> 
				I mainly create 2D characters, environments and assets for the game, the execution of which has varied
				from composing images to implementing and animating sprites in a 3D environment via King's in-house editor, which is
				comparable to Unity. 
				</p>
				<BigImage googleId={"1Gxv-GnBARWeDUD_j_9o_yOf8p1bNHagw"} />
				<p>
				I have contributed actively to the game design of new features, designed UI elements like pop-ups
				and often supported the narrative and localization crafts with writing and organizing copy.
				</p>
				<Thumbnails thumbnails={thumbnails} positions={[41]} height={444} marginBottom={33} />
				<BigImage googleId={"1TqojvVaAqOcOR5u5IZQM9MF1sOZPEckp"} />
				<p styles={{marginBottom: "0"}}>
				<em>Candy Crush Saga</em> has seen a lot of characters over the years. I have had a lot fun working with existing cast members, strengthening
				their narrative, giving make-overs and fresh outfits where necessary - and adding a few to boot!<br /><br /> 
				Next to Casey the Conductor being a permanent fixture on the rotating map built in 2020, my characters have featured mainly with live operations; the most well known are probably Didi and Rami the Candy Pets.<br /><br />
				</p>
				<Thumbnails thumbnails={thumbnails} positions={[3]} height={298} marginBottom={33} />
				<p>
				When the Candy Pet feature is active, playing levels provides candy to bake into snacks for your little hungry friend. {DIDI_URL} <br /><br /> 
				<Thumbnails thumbnails={thumbnails} positions={[4,5,6]} height={438} marginBottom={50} />
				I got to work on both the game design and art for Candy Pet. For Pet designs, we tried creating baby versions of existing <em>Candy</em> characters - and revamping classic ones to fit the <em>Candy</em> style more closely, as shown below.
				</p>
				<Thumbnails thumbnails={thumbnails} positions={[40]} height={275} marginBottom={33} />
				<BigImage googleId={"1SCv3EptzrBXjWSZEfbBMxtSoqbX187Wl"} />
				<p>
				Another character I created was the witch Caramella, who first sent main character Tiffi out hunting for potion ingredients at Halloween 2015.<br /><br />
				After a player finished a special set of levels, Caramella would transform in happiness and hand out her treats.
				</p>
				<BigImage googleId={"1kBZx5QtW8Xv02aDX8zmXHRRiUKz2snD9"} />
				<p>
				I further made the snowmen Holly and Dale, who are sometimes used for winter themed promotions. Coincidentally enough, I also created the holiday themed stockings for the
				live event 'Season's Stockings'! 
				</p>
				<BigImage googleId={"1WvdHr4wYMs0Zurtm_IvVlNp4dhYUtIdR"} />
				<p>
				Other live events I participated in producing were Mr. Snappy's Garden, the Beanstalk Challenge, Yeti's Lost Keys and a challenge for New Year's Eve 2015.<br /><br />
				Mr. Snappy's Garden especially was a fun challenge, as the small size of the team producing it meant ample opportunity to be involved with the game design.
				</p>
				<Thumbnails thumbnails={thumbnails} positions={[7,8,9]} height={337} marginBottom={33} />
				<p>
				Developing these timed event features was always fun as it involved technical implementation of the art, combined with animation and slight VFX work.<br /><br /> 
				That being said, sometimes existing features were simply reskinned to offer the player more relevant experiences.
				</p>
				<Thumbnails thumbnails={thumbnails} positions={[10,11,12]} height={374} marginBottom={33} />
				<Thumbnails thumbnails={thumbnails} positions={[13,14,15]} height={256} marginBottom={50} />
				<p>
				One of my biggest occupations within <em>Candy</em>, however, has been involvement with the Saga map format and its episodes. <br /><br />
				Episodes are bundles of 15 new levels, released every week, with custom art and narrative on the Saga map and behind the game board. 
				Here are some examples of mine!
				</p>
				<Thumbnails thumbnails={thumbnails} positions={[16,17,18]} height={248} marginBottom={33} />
				<Thumbnails thumbnails={thumbnails} positions={[19,20,21]} height={248} marginBottom={33} />
				<Thumbnails thumbnails={thumbnails} positions={[22,23,24]} height={248} marginBottom={33} />
				<p>
				At one point in time, <em>Candy</em> made the switch from a 2D to a 3D map. Now, episode art was shown more elaborately near the player's progress, 
				rather than flat images behind the game board. 
				<br /><br />
				It was an exciting challenge to both rework our old episodes into this new format and then see
				where the opportunities for new ways of showing stories could take us.
				</p>
				<Thumbnails thumbnails={thumbnails} positions={[25,26,27]} height={298} marginBottom={33} />
				<Thumbnails thumbnails={thumbnails} positions={[28,29,30]} height={298} marginBottom={33} />
				<p>
				For each episode, the team would brainstorm narrative and titles themselves, no matter how the look and feel evolded
				over the years. 
				<br /><br />
				I was actively engaged in our efforts to maintain a fresh, relevant look. Internally, this meant improving
				our ways of working continuously as well, tackling unique challenges like maintaining a decent app size for a game that's filling up 
				with years worth of content!
				</p>
				<Thumbnails thumbnails={thumbnails} positions={[31,32,33]} height={298} marginBottom={33} />
				<Thumbnails thumbnails={thumbnails} positions={[34,35,36]} height={298} marginBottom={33} />
				<p>
				I have eventually created over 50 episodes and helped out with dozens more. Even in later years it has never become a routine; in 2020 for example, representing existing
				art from external brands in the Candy Kingdom became a fresh new challenge.
				<br /><br />
				I have worked with several iconic brands such as Microsoft, Samsung and Breyers ice cream to incorporate their image in an innovative way, like reskinning Candy's main menu entirely.
				</p>
				<Thumbnails thumbnails={thumbnails} positions={[43,44,45]} height={459} marginBottom={33} />
				<p>
				As always in mobile gaming, the art has to work in landscape mode as well:
				</p>
				<BigImage googleId={"1qW5fZVXHTNQonnBSyituN12c96X3xZvk"} />
				<BigImage googleId={"1qKCDe9Xr8PRUrguJtFG2eTH9cLqk9F51"} />
				<BigImage googleId={"1CmhiFBw1JsTPu-EOYi33SKVARUNCoK65"} />
				<p>
				And let's not forget pop-ups!
				</p>
				<Thumbnails thumbnails={thumbnails} positions={[49,50,51]} height={360} marginBottom={33} />
				<p>
				Needless to say, it has been really special being a part of a live game for so long. 
				We celebrated many more milestones in mobile gaming together, with an example shown below!
				</p>
				<Video videoId={"vU9W3EWRrHQ"} hasThumbnail={'1OYFDlb7lbOwoTRmF49CgA_b-mG6g2t9I'} />
				<p>
				One great milestone was reaching level 2000 at the time, around which King also launched a great campaign. I got to work on the episode Bubblegum Bazaar, 
				featuring this special level.<br /><br /> 
				I depicted main characters Tiffi and Yeti in search what would happen after level 2000. The mischievous Bubblegum Troll was there to soothe their Y2K scare
				with a glimpse into the future.
				</p>
				<Thumbnails thumbnails={thumbnails} positions={[37,38,39]} height={248} marginBottom={0} />
				<p>
				These designs were featured on worldwide media (such asÂ {BBC_URL}), in app stores and on social media. 
				</p>
				<Video videoId={"D4pCVx6ln3E"} hasThumbnail={'1raXQnJo5wJvxvaIN-JWQJYJ2NkMbPrP8'} />
				<p>
				Another great memory was <em>Candy</em>'s first collaboration with an outside brand.<br /><br />
				Creative Director Nina Garcia of the US based magazine Marie Claire worked with King to design a <em>Candy</em> level herself. 
				<br /><br />
				The magazine did a big spread on game design and <em>Candy</em> couldn't stay behind - in the game, we launched an event where you work your way through an editor's room.
				</p>
				<BigImage googleId={"1FwmrOrI-Ird3vqjt26ArY6dLPS1mCv0W"} />
				<p>
				I was part of the team working on this in-game event by designing both the office setting and of course a Candified version of Nina Garcia! <br /><br />
				Outside of the game, the art was featured widely online in the fashion sphere, with articles on the likes of {FASHIONISTA_URL} and {WWD_URL} - and of course many, many tweets!
				</p>
				<Video videoId={"xVzDu_g8-vY"} hasThumbnail={'1cKa0YUHFQw-M5uI9FJrVBsm4uuVQXQNX'}/>
				<p>
				Behind the scenes, I have done my best to support the art function in different ways. I've done quite some in-house presentations, 
				hosted workshops centered around learning and ways of working and had a lot of fun organizing offsites and other events to promote team bonding.
				</p>
				<BigImage googleId={"1ucQgUvuuQyLz1zXfdluRD7x5HiwiYy6U"} text={"From tools to skyscrapers to sandwich material - a sample of the hundreds assets I created over the years"} />
				<p>
				Additional significant learning opportunities were, among others, attending in-house courses centered on management and leadership, 
				life drawing seminars from Samantha Youssef, sculpting by Andrea Blasich and VFX by Francisco GarcÃ­a-Obledo. <br /><br />
				Over the years I also represented 
				King at distinguished art conferences like THU and the IAMAG Master Classes.
				</p>
				<BigImage googleId={"1JWieYZ7l9H2NEtpNfJijoJ9_Ph6StTeu"} text={"Fitting custom outfits on pre-existing characters"} />
				<p>
				Outside of working with the game team and art craft, I have had many side projects supporting King as a company. I have created 
				graphics for internal use such as event invitations, office maps, portraits of players and colleagues and more. 
				</p>
				<BigImage googleId={"1hsCnMqKDz3ZSxI6s0UVl8s6ZDC6XIxec"} />
				<p>
				I sometimes work closely with King's marketing and social media team, bridging the gap between in-game art to promotional
				material and events. Some of my designs were also featured in the Candy Crush TV show.<br /><br />
				As mentioned before, I also function as a King spokesperson at times by doing interviews and other media features. This has varied from in-depth
				discussions about the game and its art to topics like women in gaming - most of which feature at the top of this page.

				</p>
				<p>
				Last but not least, I love to interact with the fans via special events and King's Community forums, with one of the highlights being a
				participation in the video thanking the fans for playing all the way to 5000 levels.<br /><br />
				That being said - new levels are still coming every week!
